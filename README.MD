# Hangmanteau
Hangmanteau is like the original game of hangman only with made-up portmanteau words.
Currently in transition between versions.

### :poop: What makes a word:
Here word is constituted by the combination of two existing words that have least 2 letters
of overlap. For example, `vodkazoo` could be a valid word as it constructible from the real
words  `vodka` and `kazoo`. The combination is formed as 'vod' + 'ka' + 'zooâ€™. Words are
generated randomly but are scored to try and produce the most interesting examples.
